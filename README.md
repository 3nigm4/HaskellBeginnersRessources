# Online (University) Courses / Tutorials

- [FPComplete - School of Haskell](https://www.schoolofhaskell.com/) 
> a compilation of many good online introductions to haskell. Very recommended on this site is [Type Families and Pokemon](https://www.schoolofhaskell.com/school/to-infinity-and-beyond/pick-of-the-week/type-families-and-pokemon) 

- [Brent Yorgey - Introduction to Haskell](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis194/lectures.html) 
> free course, recommended in School of Haskell and by the author of Haskell Programming from first principles... but if you are completely new you should read an easy Haskell book before this.

- [Functional Programming Course](https://github.com/NICTA/course) 
> free course on github recommended **after** Brent Yorgeys Course

- [Stanford : Bryan O'Sullivan : Functional Systems in Haskell](http://www.scs.stanford.edu/14sp-cs240h/) 
> free course recommended **after** the course above (NICTA).


- [EdX : Delft University : Erik Meijer : FP101x](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:DelftX+FP101x+3T2015/info)

- [Universität Bielefeld : Prof. Dr. Robert Giegerich : Programmieren in Haskell](https://www.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/ags/pi/lehre/AuDIWS13/#haskell) 
> german

- [Stephen Diehl - What I Wish I Knew When Learning Haskell](http://dev.stephendiehl.com/hask/#basics)
>best practices and good advice (as the title says). Sort of an advanced /complementary tutorial.
